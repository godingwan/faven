Faven is a combination of "favorite" and "seven". This will serve as an online favorites list storage. The twist is that a user can only have a total of seven lists of seven items.

Why seven you may be asking? Seven is prominent in many aspects. There are seven continent and seas, seven notes in a musical scale, and seven days in a week. Seven is also prominent in religion and seven is the only two syllable word among the first ten.
